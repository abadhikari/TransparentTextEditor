# TransparentTextEditor
A keyboard-only plain text editor in which the main feature is the ability to adjust the transparency. 

Currently only functions correctly on Windows. Doesn't function correctly on mac because the application was created on a windows keyboard initially and windows and mac keyboards are different. Will add mac compatibility in the future.

Things to do before running:
1) Download Javafx SDK from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/.
2) Follow the steps given at https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/ which outlines how to get javafx working.

To run:
Run the Main.java file. Shift-H will open up a help window that contains all the relevent information on how to use the transparent editor. The same information can be found below as well.
